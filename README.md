Interfacing an old military joystick for use in flight simulators on windows

My brother picked up an old joystick years ago at an army base clearing sale, this little project uses an Arduino Micro and this library https://github.com/MHeironimus/ArduinoJoystickLibrary to allow you to plug the military joystick via USB, detected as a standard game controller on windows for us in simutlator games.

The blog post explaining the project and wiring diagram is over here https://brownbot.com/2020/08/09/turning-a-military-joystick-into-a-windows-game-controller/
