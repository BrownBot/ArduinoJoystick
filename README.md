Interfacing an old military joystick for use in flight simulators on windows

My brother picked up an old joystick years at a clearing sale at an army base, this little project uses an Arduino Micro and this library https://github.com/MHeironimus/ArduinoJoystickLibrary to allow you to plug the military joystick in with USB and be detected as a standard game controller on windows for us in simutlator games.

The blog post explaining how I did it is over here https://brownbot.com/2020/08/09/turning-a-military-joystick-into-a-windows-game-controller/
